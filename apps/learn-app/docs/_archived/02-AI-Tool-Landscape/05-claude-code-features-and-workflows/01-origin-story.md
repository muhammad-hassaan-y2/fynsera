# The Claude Code Origin Story and Paradigm Shift

Most AI coding tools actually slow down developers. You describe code to ChatGPT (without showing it), get generic advice, copy-paste it, adapt it, test it, fail, repeat. The AI never sees your actual project. Every conversation starts from zero.

What if AI could simply *see* your code?

## What Actually Happened at Anthropic

In September 2024, an engineer named Boris Cherny joined Anthropic and started an experiment. He gave Claude something it had never had before: direct access to the filesystem.

What happened next revealed something the team hadn't anticipated. When Claude could read files, it didn't just answer questions better—it *explored*. Given access to a codebase, Claude naturally started reading files, following imports, understanding project structure. The behavior emerged without explicit instruction.

Cherny had discovered what the team later called the "Product Overhang": the capability to be a genuine development partner already existed inside Claude. It was waiting. The model didn't need to become smarter. It needed a product that let it actually *see* what developers were working on.

This wasn't a feature request being fulfilled. This was a hidden capability being unlocked.

But would anyone else actually want to use it?

---

## The Dogfooding Results

When Anthropic released it internally (November 2024), adoption was explosive: 20% on day one, 50% by day five. By May 2025 launch, 80%+ of engineers were using it daily.

Productivity data: engineers averaged five pull requests per day (vs. one to two at typical companies). Pull request throughput jumped 67% even as the team grew from two to ten people.

By mid-2025, Claude Code generated $500M+ annual run-rate—almost entirely from word-of-mouth. The question: what made it spread so fast?

## The Paradigm Shift: Agentic vs. Passive

Traditional AI assistants operate in a **passive model**: you describe your problem, the AI suggests something generic, you copy-paste it, you adapt it, you test it. The AI never sees your actual code.

Claude Code is **agentic**: you describe your goal, Claude reads your files, understands your patterns, proposes specific changes, and executes them with your approval. It runs tests, sees errors, and iterates.

**The difference**: Passive AI is a consultant on the phone (doesn't see your screen). Agentic AI is a pair programmer looking at your code.

### General Agents vs. Custom Agents

Claude Code is a **General Agent**—an AI that reasons through problems and takes action across domains. In Part 6, you'll build **Custom Agents** (using OpenAI SDK or Google ADK) for specific tasks. Here's the distinction:

| Aspect | General Agent (Claude Code) | Custom Agent (SDK-built) |
|--------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| Analogy | Senior consultant solving new problems | Factory machine for one specific task |
| Best for | Novel problems, debugging, exploration | Repetitive workflows, customer-facing |
| Flexibility | Handles anything | Optimized for one workflow |
| Setup time | Instant | Weeks to design and build |

**The insight:** You use Claude Code (General Agent) to *build* Custom Agents. General Agents are builders. Custom Agents are products. This is the **Agent Factory** model.

### How General Agents Think: The OODA Loop

Passive AI **predicts** the next word. Agentic AI **reasons** through problems.

When Claude Code debugs, it cycles through:
1. **Observe**: Read the error
2. **Orient**: Identify the root cause
3. **Decide**: Where to look first
4. **Act**: Read files, run commands
5. **Correct**: Adjust if the fix didn't work

This **OODA Loop** (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) repeats until the problem is solved. Claude Code doesn't just respond once—it keeps going.

| ChatGPT (Prediction) | Claude Code (Reasoning) |
|-----|-----|
| "Try X" | *runs X, sees it fail, tries Y* |
| Single response | Loops until goal is achieved |
| Can't verify suggestions | Tests its work, fixes mistakes |
| You adapt output to code | It adapts to your actual code |

## Why Terminal Integration Matters

The terminal is where the agentic model works. Claude Code reads your actual files directly—no copy-paste needed. It runs tests, sees failures, and adjusts in real time. Changes go through Git (reviewable before execution), and every action is visible. You're reviewing proposals, not trusting a black box.

---

## Agent Skills: Encoded Expertise

Before we continue, define: **Agent Skills**.

A Skill is **encoded expertise**—a document (SKILL.md) that teaches Claude a precise procedure, reasoning pattern, or domain knowledge. Think of it as a "plugin for intelligence" you can create yourself.

Your domain expertise, encoded as a Skill, is intellectual property. When you create a Skill that automates financial audits, legal contract review, or sales outreach—that's not just a tool for yourself. That's **something you can sell**.

In Lesson 18, we show you exactly how these Skills become revenue. For now: every Skill you build in this chapter is a potential product.

---

## What This Means for Developers

Here's what's real: approximately ninety percent of Claude Code was written by Claude Code itself. Not because the AI is suddenly brilliant. Because the agentic model gives it the *access* it needs. When AI can read code, understand patterns, run tests, and iterate—it becomes capable of complex work.

This is the future you're entering.

## Try With AI

**🔍 Explore the Friction:**

> "I use ChatGPT for coding help. Show me one workflow where copy-paste friction wastes time—maybe debugging an error or integrating a library. Then show what that same workflow looks like with filesystem access. What do I type? What does the AI see? What's different?"

**💡 Understand Product Overhang:**

> "Claude could already explore codebases—it just needed filesystem access. What other capabilities are locked inside AI models right now, waiting for the right product? Give me 2-3 examples."

**🚀 Apply to Your Work:**

> "I work on [your domain]. Based on the paradigm shift, what parts of my workflow involve the most copy-paste friction? Where would filesystem access help most?"

**Note:** Start with non-sensitive projects. Review changes before accepting.
