# MCP Integration: Connecting to External Systems

Right now, Claude Code can only see **files on your computer**.

But what if you need Claude to:
- Browse a website to find information?
- Check the latest documentation for a library?
- Query a database?
- Access an API?

**Skills (Lessons 5-8) taught Claude *how* to do things. MCP teaches Claude *where* to find outside information.**

All of that data lives **outside your computer**. Claude Code can't reach it... yet.

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** solves this problem. It's like giving Claude Code safe, approved access to the outside world.

## Think of MCP Like This

Imagine Claude Code is a brilliant assistant who works in your office (your computer).

**Without MCP**: Your assistant can only use what's in the office—files on your desk, folders in your cabinet. That's it.

**With MCP**: You give your assistant a **phone directory** with approved contacts—a web browser expert, a documentation specialist, a database consultant. Now when your assistant needs outside information, they can call the right expert and get answers safely.

**MCP is that phone directory.** It connects Claude Code (your AI agent) to external tools and data sources in a **standardized, safe way**.

---

## Skills + MCP: Expertise Packs Meet Data Pipes

Here's a powerful mental model from Anthropic:

| Component | Role | Analogy |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **Skills** | The "How-To" — expertise packs | Teaching Claude a specific workflow |
| **MCP** | The "With-What" — data pipes | Connecting skills to live data |

**Skills are Expertise Packs**: They encode your procedures, your quality criteria, your domain knowledge. "How to analyze financial statements according to our Q4 risk framework."

**MCP provides Data Pipes**: They connect those expertise packs to live data sources. Your SQL database. Your Jira board. The web.

**Together**: Claude knows HOW to do something (skill) and has access to WHAT it needs (MCP).

**Example**: A skill encodes your company's financial reporting procedures. An MCP server connects Claude to your accounting database. Result: automated reports that follow your exact standards using real-time data.

---

## Why This Matters: Safe External Integration

**Workflow Impact**: MCP gives Claude Code safe, standardized access beyond your local files. Without it, AI is limited to your codebase. With it, AI can browse documentation, fetch real-time data, interact with external services—all through secure, permission-controlled protocols.

**Paradigm Connection**: This is where AI-driven development becomes truly powerful. CLAUDE.md (Lesson 05) gives AI your project context. MCP gives AI access to the *entire world* of external knowledge and tools—documentation, APIs, databases, web content—while maintaining security boundaries.

**Real-World Context**: When building production applications, you'll use MCP to:
- Fetch latest library documentation (Context7 MCP)
- Test web interfaces automatically (Playwright MCP)
- Query databases safely (PostgreSQL MCP)
- Access internal company APIs (custom MCP servers)

MCP is the bridge between local context and external intelligence.

## Why This Matters: What MCP Unlocks

Still not convinced you need MCP? Here's what changes:

| Task | Without MCP | With MCP |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Browse Amazon for products** | Can't—no web access. You do the shopping. | Playwright MCP: Claude navigates, extracts prices/reviews, summarizes results |
| **Check React docs for latest API** | Uses training data (outdated). May hallucinate. | Context7 MCP: Fetches current docs. Real examples. Live citations. |
| **Query your production database** | Can't—no database access. You run queries, paste results. | Database MCP: Claude executes queries safely, analyzes results |
| **Post updates to your Slack channel** | Can't—no API access. You copy-paste manually. | Slack MCP: Claude sends messages, threads, reactions automatically |
| **Analyze a GitHub repo structure** | Can't—no GitHub access. You clone locally. | GitHub MCP: Claude clones, analyzes, answers questions about code |
| **Risk of data exposure** | N/A | All secured: MCP uses allow-lists, tokens stored in keychain, no secrets in plain text |

**The pattern**: Without MCP, you're the bottleneck. With MCP, Claude Code becomes your autonomous partner.

## What Is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

**Simple definition**: MCP lets Claude Code safely use external tools through standardized connections.

**An "MCP server"** is a helper tool Claude can call:
- **Playwright MCP**: Lets Claude browse websites
- **Context7 MCP**: Lets Claude fetch up-to-date documentation
- **GitHub MCP**: Lets Claude query GitHub repositories
- **Database MCP**: Lets Claude query databases

Think of each MCP server as a **specialist** Claude Code can consult when needed.

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt
> "Explain how MCP provides safe external access compared to direct API calls. What security model does MCP use to protect user data?"

## In This Lesson

You will:
1. Add two beginner-friendly MCP servers to Claude Code
2. Try real workflows: browse Amazon, fetch docs
3. Understand when you need external access

No programming experience required. Just copy, paste, and see it work.

## A Note on Security (Read This First)

**Why security matters with MCP**: Unlike working with local files, MCP servers can access the internet, APIs, and external systems. This is powerful but requires trust.

**Stay safe**:
- Use trusted MCP servers. In this lesson we'll use two widely used, reputable servers: Playwright MCP and Context7 MCP.
- Your tokens and secrets are stored in your system keychain (not plain text).
- Never paste secrets into files; use prompts when Claude asks or environment variables.

---

## Hands-On: Add Two Helpful MCP Servers

We'll add two servers using simple commands.

```bash
# 1) Playwright MCP (browse the web)
claude mcp add --transport stdio playwright npx @playwright/mcp@latest

# 2) Context7 MCP (get up-to-date docs)
claude mcp add --transport stdio context7 npx @upstash/context7-mcp
```

**What's happening**: You're telling Claude Code about two external helpers it can use. Each command registers an MCP server that Claude can invoke when relevant.

## Workflow 1: Shop Together — Find a Shirt on Amazon (Playwright MCP)

Goal: Ask Claude to browse Amazon and find a shirt that matches your preferences. No code—just a plain request.

In Claude Code, say:

```
Use the Playwright MCP to browse Amazon. Find 3 men's casual shirts under $30 with good reviews. Share links, prices, main features, and any sizing notes. Prefer neutral colors.
```

What happens:
- Claude launches the Playwright MCP to visit Amazon
- It navigates pages, extracts details, and returns a neat summary with links
- You can iterate naturally: "filter to long-sleeve" or "show only Prime-eligible"

**Expected Output Example:**

Claude will return something similar to this (content varies by what's available):

```
Found 3 men's casual shirts under $30 with good reviews:

1. **Amazon Essentials Oxford Button-Down**
   - Price: $19.99 (Prime eligible)
   - Rating: 4.2/5 stars (2,341 reviews)
   - Colors: Navy, Gray, White
   - Sizing: Runs true to size; machine washable
   - URL: https://amazon.com/dp/B0XXXXXX
   - Why it matches: Great price, neutral colors, solid reviews

2. **Goodthreads Casual Oxford**
   - Price: $24.99
   - Rating: 4.5/5 stars (1,892 reviews)
   - Colors: Light Blue, Khaki, Navy
   - Sizing: Consider sizing up one size
   - URL: https://amazon.com/dp/B0YYYYYY
   - Why it matches: Excellent reviews, price under budget

3. **J.Crew Factory Essential Shirt**
   - Price: $29.99
   - Rating: 4.6/5 stars (3,204 reviews)
   - Colors: Sage Green, White, Cream
   - Sizing: True to size
   - URL: https://amazon.com/dp/B0ZZZZZZ
   - Why it matches: Highest rated option, neutral earth tones
```

**Note**: Real results vary by region, availability, and when you run this. Amazon changes its page structure frequently, so Claude adapts its browsing steps. The format (links, prices, ratings) stays consistent.

If you get an error:
- Ensure `playwright` MCP is registered: `claude mcp list`
- Try again; websites change often, so Claude may adjust its browsing steps
- Verify your internet connection is stable

---

## Workflow 2: Learn What's New — Ask for MCP Docs (Context7 MCP)

Goal: Ask Claude to use Context7 to fetch and summarize the latest resources about MCP in Claude Code.

In Claude Code, say:

```
Use the Context7 MCP to fetch the latest official documentation and articles about MCP support in Claude Code. Summarize what MCP is, how to add a server, and any recent changes or best practices. Include links and short quotes for key points.
```

What happens:
- Claude queries Context7's knowledge sources for up-to-date docs
- You get a short, current summary with citations and links
- Ask follow-ups: "show the exact CLI command to add a server via stdio" or "compare Context7 MCP vs GitHub MCP"

**Expected Output Example:**

Claude returns something like (real docs are current, not from memory):

```
## Model Context Protocol (MCP) - Latest Summary

**What is MCP?**
An open standard that allows Claude Code to safely access external tools, APIs, and data sources. The official docs (modelcontextprotocol.io) define MCP as "a unified protocol for connecting language models to external systems."

**How to Add an MCP Server**

Using the stdio transport (current standard in 2026):
```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio <name> <command>
```

Example—Playwright:
```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio playwright npx @playwright/mcp@latest
```

Verify installation:
```bash
claude mcp list
```

**Recent Changes (2026)**
- Stdio transport is now the default (network-based was beta in 2025)
- Permission model: Explicit allow-list per server in CLAUDE.md
- Context7 expanded to 200+ library documentation sources (50 in 2025)
- GitHub MCP now supports searching PRs and issues

**Best Practices (from official docs)**
1. Use allow-list configuration—only approve servers you trust
2. Test MCP servers in isolated projects before production
3. Keep servers updated: `claude mcp update --all`
4. Never store secrets in MCP commands—use environment variables

**Official Resources**
- Main docs: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs
- Getting started: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started
- Server implementations: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol
```

**Note**: Context7 fetches live documentation, so you always get the most current information. This beats searching Google and sifting through 10 outdated blog posts.

**Tip**: This is your "know about anything new" button. Use it anytime you need the latest docs without hunting across websites.

## When to Use MCP (And When NOT To)

MCP is powerful, but it's not the right tool for everything. This section shows you the boundaries.

### ✅ When to Use MCP

**Use MCP when you need:**
- **Current information** (docs change frequently, your training data is outdated)
- **Real-time data** (stock prices, database queries, API responses)
- **Web interaction** (browsing, testing, scraping)
- **Safe external integration** (calling trusted APIs with permission controls)

**Example**: You're building a financial dashboard. Use MCP with a database server to fetch real-time trading data. Skills handle calculations. MCP handles data access.

### ❌ When NOT to Use MCP

**Don't use MCP for private/sensitive data:**
- Company financial records, personal keys, SSH credentials
- Confidential customer data, proprietary algorithms
- **Better approach**: Use local file access or store secrets in environment variables, then prompt Claude to retrieve them locally

**Example wrong**: "Use MCP to fetch our accounting database"
**Example right**: "Here's the database dump (local file). Analyze using this skill."

**Don't use MCP for real-time high-frequency queries:**
- If you need 1000 database queries/second, use direct connections
- MCP adds latency per call (network roundtrip + Claude reasoning)
- **Appropriate workflow**: ~10 queries/minute with MCP; real-time streaming needs direct connections

**Example wrong**: "Continuously monitor 500 database records every second"
**Example right**: "Check production health metrics every 5 minutes and alert me"

**Don't use MCP from untrusted servers:**
- Only use MCP servers from: Anthropic's official list, Modelcontextprotocol.io, verified npm packages
- A malicious MCP server could expose your system, read your files, access your tokens
- **Check before installing**: Read source code on GitHub, verify maintainer reputation, check recent commits

**Example wrong**: `claude mcp add mystery-tool some-random-npm-package`
**Example right**: `claude mcp add playwright npx @playwright/mcp@latest` (widely used, verified source)

**Don't build custom MCP servers before you understand the basics:**
- Master Playwright and Context7 first (this lesson)
- Understand the security model (permission allow-lists, token storage)
- **Advanced topic**: Building custom MCP servers for databases, internal APIs (Part 7, Chapter 38)

**Example wrong**: "I'll build a custom MCP to access our Jira board today"
**Example right**: "I'll try Playwright/Context7 first, then explore custom MCP next quarter"

#### 🎓 Expert Insight: The Three Pillars of AI-Native Development

**You've now learned the complete architecture.**

Remember **Lesson 05 (CLAUDE.md)**? You taught Claude your project: files, folder structure, coding standards, team practices. That gave Claude Code *context*.

Then **Lesson 08 (Skills)**? You taught Claude your domain procedures: workflows, decision trees, quality standards. That gave Claude Code *procedures*.

Now **Lesson 9 (MCP)** teaches Claude where to find the world's knowledge and tools. That gives Claude Code *reach*.

**Together, these three pillars form the foundation of AI-native development:**

```
CLAUDE.md  → Claude knows YOUR PROJECT
   ↓
Skills     → Claude knows YOUR PROCEDURES
   ↓
MCP        → Claude knows THE WORLD'S TOOLS
   ↓
Result: A Digital FTE that understands your goals, knows how you work, and can access any external system safely
```

**Why this matters**: Without CLAUDE.md, Claude is generic. Without skills, Claude repeats itself. Without MCP, Claude is blind to the outside world. With all three, Claude becomes truly autonomous.

This is the thesis of AI-native development: **Context + Procedures + Access = Digital FTE**.

---

## What's Ahead

MCP extends Claude Code's reach from your local filesystem to the entire world of external systems. But Claude Code can do more than just access external tools—it can delegate complex tasks to specialized assistants.

### Coming Up: Subagents

Lesson 11 introduces **subagents**: focused AI specialists that handle specific types of work with isolated context. Where MCP gives Claude Code new *capabilities*, subagents give Claude Code a *team*.

## Try With AI

Let's explore MCP integration through hands-on practice with external system access.

**🔍 Explore MCP Capabilities:**

> "I've successfully added the Playwright MCP for web browsing. Show me 3 specific web testing tasks I could accomplish with this MCP right now. For each task, give me the exact prompt I should use and explain what Playwright will do."

**🎯 Practice Building Workflows:**

> "I need to test [describe your specific web application or research goal]. Walk me through building a complete workflow using Playwright MCP (for web browsing) and Context7 MCP (for documentation). Include: which MCP handles which part, exact prompts I should use, and how to verify everything works."

**🧪 Troubleshoot Integration Issues:**

> "I'm trying to add an MCP server and it's not working. I ran [paste your installation command]. The error says [paste error message]. Walk me through troubleshooting: What's the most likely cause? What should I check? Give me 3 diagnostic commands to run with expected outputs."

**🛡️ Establish Security Boundaries:**

> "The lesson emphasizes MCP security. I'm nervous about giving Claude Code external access. Help me establish safe boundaries: What types of MCP servers should I avoid as a beginner? What permissions are risky? How do I audit what an MCP server can access? Create an MCP safety checklist I can follow."
